        For each group of 3 different symbols, each player scores 7 victory
        points.

        Example: Continuing the above example, Alexandria has built 6 scientific
        structures but only has a single group of 3 different symbols, they
        score 7 extra points for a total of 21 victory points. If Alexandria had
        built an extra structure with the symbol, they wouldâ€™ve scored: (9 + 4 +
        4) + (7 + 7) = 31 victory points
      </p>
    </>
  );
};
